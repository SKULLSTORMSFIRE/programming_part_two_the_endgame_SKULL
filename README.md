# programming_part_two_the_endgame_SKULL
The game I made for my programming two assignment which I got 75%, see the readme for the full question.

40%
All of the following to Pass (40%):
 Player character near top of the screen with arrow key controlled left & right
movement
 Minimum 2 classes : Player, Attacker
 At least one attacker object that moves up the screen
 Simple working game (comment out code that causes errors) in Processing
 Something clearly happens when a player collides with an attacker

40-50%
All of the above, and some of the following:
 Player must be restricted to being on the screen
 At least 3 attacker objects that move up the screen (and possibly left,right)
 Working Collision function method(s)

50-60%
All of the above, and some of the following:
 Splash or game over screen (draw does different things at different times)
 An ArrayList (or array) of attacker objects
 Animated sequence of images for the attacker objects (appears to climb, fly, etc)
  
60-70%
All of the above, and some of the following:
 Player can drop objects (attacker removed from game on collision)
 A 2nd type (class) of attacker objects that must be avoided by the player (collision
involves loss of life or game end)
 Class-inheritance for different attacker types (perhaps other classes)
 File handling – high score(s) saved and read from file
  
70-80%
All of the above, and some of the following
 Array of PImages for animation sequence
 Exhibits some polymorphism with the array/arrayList of attackers
  
80%+
All of the above, and some of the following:
 collision animation sequence (e.g. explosion)
 Complex attacker movements (e.g. sometimes follow the player)
 Polymorphism for most (or all) game entities
 Use of an Interface or abstract class
 Refactored, maintainable code
